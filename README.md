OpenCore EFI for Huawei Matebook D 2018 (MRC-W50)

CPU:Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz (Kaby Lake)
GPU:HD 620
RAM:16GB DDR4
WIFI and Bluetooth:BCM94352Z

Opencore version 0.7.7
Everything is ok in big sur 11.6

The only known issue:

At the first update form bigsur to monterey, when the install program is finished, the first try to enter the system is worked. 
But! After the restart ,the opencore EFI seems to be some problems and can not get into the monterey.

Here is some codes in -v mode: <- EB.CS.UFVK

I don't know how to fix this,and when I reinstall the big sur 11.6, the system is worked again. 

All in all, the EFI is worked in big sur and not ready to Monterey yet. 
I wish someone can fix the problem of my EFI, thanks.
